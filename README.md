**THIS REPO IS ARCHIVAL**

_In late 2021 I moved all of my CircuitPython experiments to repo with a broader mandate, [`circuitpython-experiments`](https://github.com/fivesixzero/circuitpython-experiments/)._

# magtag-experiments

Experiments with Adafruit's excellent and super-fun MagTag device

## Experiments So Far

1. `weather-tag`: Simple forecast retrieval from US National Weather Service website
2. `tasmota-tag`: Basic controller for up to 8 Tasmota-flashed LED smart bulbs
